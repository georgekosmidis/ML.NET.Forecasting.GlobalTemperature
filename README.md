# Microsoft.ML.Forecasting.GlobalTemperature

This is just a sample that predicts the global average land temperature. In machine learning, the prediction of specific numeric values based on past observed data, is known as regression.

## Dataset
The original data comes from a public dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data?select=GlobalTemperatures.csv
